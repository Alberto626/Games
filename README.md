# Description
A very simple TicTacToe game currently using Spring Boot with Spring security features. This includes Player vs Player, and Player vs BOT

We the use of Spring controllers, we were able to create restful apis that allowed a more dynamic and changeable frontend. This includes a very basic implementation of polling to constantly survey any changes a player makes and display it during its next rotation.
